    <h1>Creamy Bay Scallop Spaghetti</h1>
    <img src="Creamy Scallop.webp" alt="">
    <p>This scallop pasta dinner with a creamy sauce is fast and easy. 
        I cook the scallops a bit longer than many chefs, but that gives the dish more flavor and 
        they're still tender and moist.  I think you'll agree, 
        the sherry sauce benefits significantly from the longer cook time.</p>
